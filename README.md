### About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Adrian-Dupuis! I'm an American-French Engineer, originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and currently living in Paris, France.  

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. I am also equally passionate about Genneral Engineering, Energy Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biological/Biochemical Engineering, Biochemistry/Biophysics, and Healthcare.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a big believer in Lifelong Learning and am constantly following one or more MOOCs. I have been a Teaching Assistant for a course in Downstream Processing of Biomolecules and throughly enjoyed the experience; I believe one of the best ways to learn a subject is to be able to teach it to someone else.
